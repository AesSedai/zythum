# zythum
**zythum** is a Factorio mod wrapper that will sort all your base game and modded items into more reasonable categories. The aim of this mod is to clean up the Factorio UI, especially the crafting menu, no matter what kind of mod you use for your current game.

This mod was inspired by [ZGroupChange](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Progsy/ZGroupChange), however, while ZGroupChange provides renaming for some famous mods and even adds some new items and technology, it highly depends on all of the supported core mods to be loaded. It will otherwise fail, hide items, or mess up your UI.

Zythum will not add any research or items and will also not be dependent on any specific mods. It uses a completely different approach than ZGroupChange, meaning every single item will be assigned a group and not just batches of items from other mods. This way, the mod will not cause any weird behaviour with custom modpacks.

## Supported mods
